# hello-world
Starting out strong

My name is Maz and I like tacos. This is my first repository that I will be working on my first code from. I am a petrloleum engineering student who still hasn't figured out if tech is my passion or the oil/gas industry. Why not combine digital energy/tech with the energy industry? 
Follow me on the dopest site called everipedia.com, I didn't code it for anything but I am here to help develop it.
